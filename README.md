How to Play Racing Game

Ultimate goal
It is a two-player racing game, and the goal is to complete three laps faster than your opponent. The winner will be able to put the name on the ranking page.

Control:


Player1

w - forward

s - backward

a - left turn

d - right turn

left shift button - booster


Player2

↑ - forward

↓ - backward

← - left turn

→ - right turn

right shift button - booster


Collision
If you collide with the middle part of the map or the opponent, your car will go to the opposite way of where you are heading, so you should avoid collision as much as possible. If you collide while you are using booster, then you will lose it.

Hazard
The sides of the map represent grass where your car gets really slow, so you should avoid there, too.

Booster
If you go through the booster picture at the bottom of the map, you will be able to use booster, which makes your car faster. If you want to use it, just press “shift” button of your nearest. For player 1, press the left shift button. For player 2, press the right shift button.

Good luck!!
